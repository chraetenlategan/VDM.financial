<h2>The Chartered Accountant's (South Africa) Declaration</h2>
<p>The following annual financial statements of ${co}, as presented on pages ${pageStart} to ${pageEnd}, have been independently compiled by a Chartered Accountant (South Africa) [CA(SA)]. Refer to compilation report on page ${pg3}.</p>
<p>Use of the CA(SA) designation is governed by the <em>Chartered Accountants Designation (Private) Act</em>, 1993 (Act 67 of 1993), which regulates and permits the use of the CA(SA) designation exclusively by members of The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA). Use of the designation without SAICA membership is consequently a criminal offence, and misuse is subject to legal action.</p>
<p>SAICA is the premier accountancy body in South Africa and one of the leading chartered accountancy institutes in the world and all members must comply with the Code of Professional Conduct which conforms to the code released by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA). The SAICA code and definitions contained therein are consistent in all material aspects with the International Federation of Accountants' (IFAC) code as well as the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA) code.</p>
<p>The following fundamental principles are embodied in the SAICA Code of Professional Conduct and are to be upheld by all CA's(SA) at all times.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Integrity</strong> — a duty to be straightforward and honest in all professional and business relationships.</li>
  <li><strong>Objectivity</strong> — a duty to not allow bias, conflict of interest or undue influence of others to override professional or business judgments.</li>
  <li><strong>Professional competence and due care</strong> — a duty to maintain professional knowledge and skill at the level required to ensure that a client receives competent professional services based on current developments in practice, legislation and techniques and act diligently and in accordance with applicable technical and professional standards.</li>
  <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong> — a duty to respect the confidentiality of information acquired as a result of professional and business relationships and, therefore, not disclose any such information to third parties without proper and specific authority, unless there is a legal or professional right or duty to disclose, nor use the information for the personal advantage of the chartered accountant or third parties.</li>
  <li><strong>Professional behaviour</strong> — a duty to comply with relevant laws and regulations and avoid any action that discredits the accountancy profession.</li>
</ul>
<p>A distinguishing characteristic of CA's(SA) are their responsibilities and duties which extend beyond the needs of individual clients and also includes the public as a whole.</p>
<p>Accordingly, this declaration serves to confirm that the above mentioned financial statements have been prepared by a CA(SA) who has observed and complied with the SAICA Code.</p>

<p>${bodyTerm} ${dirSingularPlural.isAre} required in terms of the ${terms.act}, to maintain adequate accounting records and ${dirSingularPlural.isAre} responsible for the content and integrity of the financial statements and related financial information included in this report. It is ${pronoun} responsibility to ensure that the financial statements fairly present the state of affairs of the entity as at the end of the financial year and the results of its operations and cash flows for the period then ended, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards for Small and Medium-sized Entities and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.</p>
<p>The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards for Small and Medium-sized Entities and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa and are based upon appropriate accounting policies consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates.</p>
<p>${bodyTerm} acknowledge that ${dirSingularPlural.theirIts} are ultimately responsible for the system of internal financial control established by the entity and place considerable emphasis on maintaining a strong control environment. To enable the ${pluralTerm.toLowerCase()} to meet these responsibilities, the board sets standards for internal control aimed at reducing the risk of error or loss in a cost-effective manner. The standards include the proper delegation of responsibilities within a clearly defined framework, effective accounting procedures and adequate segregation of duties to ensure an acceptable level of risk. These controls are monitored throughout the entity and all employees are required to maintain the highest ethical standards in ensuring the entity's business is conducted in a manner that in all reasonable circumstances is above reproach. The focus of risk management in the entity is on identifying, assessing, managing and monitoring all known forms of risk. While operating risk cannot be fully eliminated, the entity endeavours to minimise it by ensuring that appropriate infrastructure, controls, systems and ethical behaviour are applied and managed within predetermined procedures and constraints.</p>
<p>${bodyTerm} ${dirSingularPlural.isAre} of the opinion, based on the information and explanations given by management that the system of internal control provides reasonable assurance that the financial records may be relied on for the preparation of the financial statements. However, any system of internal financial control can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.</p>
<p>${bodyTerm} ${dirSingularPlural.hasHave} reviewed the cash flow forecast for the year and, in the light of this review and the current financial position, ${dirCount === 1 ? 'is' : 'they are'} satisfied that the entity has access to adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The financial statements set out on pages ${pageStart} to ${pageEnd}, which have been prepared on the going concern basis, were approved by the board on ${dateApproved} and are signed on its behalf:</p>

<h3>Independent Reviewer's Responsibility</h3>
<p>Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these financial statements. We conducted our review in accordance with the <em>'International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2400 (Revised), Engagements to Review Historical Financial Statements (ISRE 2400 (Revised)).

<p>A review of financial statements in accordance with <em>ISRE 2400 (Revised)</em> is a limited assurance engagement.

We are independent of the company in accordance with the <em>'Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors Code of Professional Conduct for Registered Auditors (IRBA Code)'</em> and other independence requirements applicable to performing audits of financial statements in South Africa. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the <em>'IRBA Code'</em> and in accordance with other ethical requirements applicable to performing audits in South Africa. The <em>'IRBA Code'</em> is consistent with the <em>'International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (Parts A and B)'</em>.

<p>In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

<h3>Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements</h3>
<p>Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with <em>'International Standards on Auditing (ISAs)'</em> will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

  <li>Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the governing body.</li>
  <li>Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.</li>

<h2>Trustees' Responsibilities and Approval</h2>
<p>The trustees are required in terms of the <em>Sectional Titles Schemes Management Act, 2011</em>, <em>the Sectional Titles Schemes Management Regulations, 2016 and the Management Rules of the body corporate</em> established in terms thereof, to maintain adequate accounting records and are responsible for the content and integrity of the financial statements and related financial information included in this report. It is their responsibility to ensure that the financial statements fairly present the state of affairs of the entity as at the end of the financial year and the results of its operations and cash flows for the period then ended, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards for Small and Medium-sized Entities and the requirements of the <em>Sectional Titles Schemes Management Act, 2011</em>, <em>the Sectional Titles Schemes Management Regulations, 2016 and the Management Rules of the body corporate</em> established in terms thereof.</p>
<p>The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards for Small and Medium-sized Entities and the requirements of the <em>Sectional Titles Schemes Management Act, 2011</em>, <em>the Sectional Titles Schemes Management Regulations, 2016 and the Management Rules of the body corporate</em> established in terms thereof and are based upon appropriate accounting policies consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates.</p>
<p>The trustees acknowledge that they are ultimately responsible for the system of internal financial control established by the entity and place considerable emphasis on maintaining a strong control environment. To enable the trustees to meet these responsibilities, the board sets standards for internal control aimed at reducing the risk of error or loss in a cost-effective manner. The standards include the proper delegation of responsibilities within a clearly defined framework, effective accounting procedures and adequate segregation of duties to ensure an acceptable level of risk. These controls are monitored throughout the entity and all employees are required to maintain the highest ethical standards in ensuring the body corporate's business is conducted in a manner that in all reasonable circumstances is above reproach. The focus of risk management in the body corporate is on identifying, assessing, managing and monitoring all known forms of risk across the body corporate. While operating risk cannot be fully eliminated, the entity endeavours to minimise it by ensuring that appropriate infrastructure, controls, systems and ethical behaviour are applied and managed within predetermined procedures and constraints.</p>
<p>The trustees are of the opinion, based on the information and explanations given by management that the system of internal control provides reasonable assurance that the financial records may be relied on for the preparation of the financial statements. However, any system of internal financial control can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.</p>
<p>The trustees have reviewed the cash flow forecast for the year and, in the light of this review and the current financial position, they are satisfied that the body corporate has access to adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The external auditors are responsible for independently auditing and reporting on the body corporate's financial statements. The financial statements have been examined by the body corporate's external auditors and their report is presented on page 2.</p>
<p>The financial statements set out on pages ${pageStart} to ${pageEnd}, which have been prepared on the going concern basis, were approved by the board on ${dateApproved} and are signed on its behalf:</p>

<p><strong>APPOINTMENT TO PROVIDE SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>Following our recent discussion with you, we are pleased to confirm acceptance of our engagement to provide accounting, taxation and secretarial services to you. This letter sets forth our understanding of the terms and objectives of our engagement, and the nature and scope of the services we will provide. This letter is effective as from ${dateSigned || '[DATE]'} and does not need to be completed annually, but only when amendments are to be made.</p>
<p><em><strong>Accounting records; preparing of financial statements; taxation and secretarial services:</strong></em></p>
<p>All the above duties are the responsibility of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'members' : entityType === 'trust' || entityType === 'bc' ? 'trustees' : 'directors'} of ${co} as set out in various different acts and laws including but not limited to the Companies Act, Income Tax Act, Labour Act, etc. We will assist you in various ways to fulfill your responsibilities.</p>
<p>We will prepare accounting records, financial statements and cash-flow projections as per your request. We will also prepare and submit various returns on your behalf including income tax, dividend tax, PAYE, IRP5 reconciliations, VAT, UIF, workmen's compensation, etc. as per your request. We will assist you with the secretarial services of your entity as prescribed by the various acts applicable on your request.</p>
<p>All the above services will be based on the information supplied by you. Any enquiries and investigations that we may undertake in respect of supporting evidence are for the purpose of enabling us to adequately provide you with the services alone, and therefore do not fall outside the description of our appointment.</p>
<p>We may also be obliged to take certain action if, during the performance of our duties as accountants and tax practitioners, we become aware of contraventions of the Prevention of Organized Crime Act 121 of 1998 and the Financial Intelligence Centre Act 38 of 2001.</p>
<p><em><strong>Deadlines:</strong></em></p>
<p>As all or most of our services have to be completed at a certain date, we request that information is supplied to us in advance, taking the time that we need to complete the work into consideration. We will as far as possible send reminders of deadlines, but the responsibility to supply the relevant documentation before the deadline, lies with you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Excluded services:</strong></em></p>
<p>This letter only relates to services as described and does not extend to services such as audits and reviews of financial statements.</p>
<p><em><strong>Liability and limitations:</strong></em></p>
<p>We will provide the professional services outlined in this letter with reasonable care and skill as our reputation over decades speaks for itself. Our advice to you will be based on our interpretation of the law and our experience with SARS and other role players. Therefore the conclusions reached and views expressed will often be matters of opinion rather than certainty and we cannot warrant that SARS and others will necessarily reach the same conclusions. We will not be responsible for any losses, penalties, interest or additional tax liabilities arising for whichever reason as the responsibility at all times lies with the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'members' : entityType === 'trust' || entityType === 'bc' ? 'trustees' : 'directors'}.</p>
<p>Our maximum liability for any claims that might arise out of services provided by us shall be limited to the total amount of fees charged by us for our services over the 12 months preceding our claim. The maximum liability shall be the aggregate liability for all claims arising from whatsoever source.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fees:</strong></em></p>
<p>Our fees will be calculated on the basis of time spent on your affairs by partners and personnel. Rates charged are based on experience and qualification of various personnel. Accounts will be sent to you at appropriate intervals during the course of the year. Our account is payable on presentation on which interest will be charged on any outstanding balance older than 60 days. The ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'members' : entityType === 'trust' || entityType === 'bc' ? 'trustees' : 'directors'} accept full responsibility in their personal capacity for the payment of any outstanding balance should the entity prove not to be able to pay the outstanding balance. We have the right to retention over all documents prepared by us and have the right to suspend all services rendered by us until such time as our account is settled in full.</p>
<p>This letter will be effective for future years unless it is terminated or suspended.</p>
<p>Kindly acknowledge receipt of this letter. Should the content not correspond with your view of our terms of engagement, we will gladly discuss this matter further with you.</p>

<p><strong>ENGAGEMENT LETTER TO REVIEW FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The objective and scope of the review and our responsibilities</strong></em></p>
<p>You have requested that we review the financial statements of ${co} for the year ended ${yearEnd}, comprising the statement of financial position, the statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the ${entityType === 'cc' ? "members'" : entityType === 'trust' || entityType === 'bc' ? "trustees'" : "directors'"} report. We are pleased to confirm our acceptance and our understanding of this review engagement by means of this letter. We will conduct our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (ISRE) 2400 — Engagements to Review Financial Statements. ISRE 2400 requires us to conclude whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are not prepared in all material respects in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework or stated accounting policies. ISRE 2400 also requires us to comply with relevant ethical requirements. A review of financial statements in accordance with ISRE 2400 consists primarily of making inquiries of management and others within the entity that are involved in financial and accounting matters, applying analytical procedures and evaluating the sufficiency and appropriateness of their view evidence obtained. A review may also include any other procedures we consider necessary in the circumstances of the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence as the basis for our conclusion on the financial statements as a whole. The procedures selected will depend on what we consider necessary, applying our professional judgment, based on our understanding of the entity and its environment, and our understanding of the applicable financial reporting framework or stated accounting policies and its application in the circumstances. We will not perform an audit of the financial statements. As we are engaged to review the financial statements:</p>
<p>There is a commensurate higher risk that any material misstatements that exist in the financial statements reviewed may not be revealed by the review, even though the review is properly performed in accordance with ISRE 2400. The procedures performed in a review engagement do not provide all the evidence that would be required in an audit.</p>
<p>In expressing our review conclusion, our report on the financial statements will state that an audit has not been performed and that we do not express an audit opinion on the financial statements.</p>
<p><em><strong>Responsibilities of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'members' : entityType === 'trust' || entityType === 'bc' ? 'trustees' : 'directors'}</strong></em></p>
<p>The ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'members are' : entityType === 'trust' || entityType === 'bc' ? 'trustees are' : 'directors are'} responsible for the calculation of the public interest score in accordance with Regulation 26 of the Companies Regulations, 2011. The entity's public interest score should be calculated by the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'members' : entityType === 'trust' || entityType === 'bc' ? 'trustees' : 'directors'} at year-end for the current financial year. It is the sole responsibility of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'members' : entityType === 'trust' || entityType === 'bc' ? 'trustees' : 'directors'} to determine the appropriateness of a review engagement in the circumstances of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'}, in compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act, 2008, and taking cognizance of any other requirements or agreements that may be applicable to the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'}.</p>
<p>Our review will be conducted on the basis that you acknowledge and understand that you have responsibility:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (IFRS for SMEs) and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa;</li>
  <li>For such internal control as you determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and</li>
  <li>To provide us with access to all information of which you are aware that is relevant to the preparation of the financial statements, such as records, documentation and other matters, additional information that we may request from you for the purpose of the review, and unrestricted access to persons within the entity from whom we determine it necessary to obtain evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of our review, we will request from management and, where appropriate, from those charged with governance, written confirmation concerning representations made to us in connection with the review.</p>
<p><em><strong>Reporting</strong></em></p>
<p>As stated above, our review will be conducted with the objective of expressing a review conclusion on the financial statements as a whole. Our review conclusion will be communicated in a written report. If the review conclusion on the financial statements of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'} is unmodified, it is currently expected to read as follows:</p>
<p>"Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial statements do not present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'} at the reporting date, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (IFRS for SMEs) and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa." However, the form and contents of our report may need to be amended in the light of our findings obtained from the review.</p>
<p><em><strong>Reportable irregularities in terms of Regulation 29 of the Companies Regulations, 2011</strong></em></p>
<p>It is our responsibility to inform you regarding our obligation, in terms of Regulation 29 of the Companies Regulations, 2011, to report reportable irregularities to the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (the Commission).</p>
<p>A "reportable irregularity" refers to any act or omission committed by any person responsible for the management of a ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'}, which:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unlawfully has caused or is likely to cause material financial loss to the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'} or to any member, shareholder, creditor or investor of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'} in respect of his, her or its dealings with that entity; or</li>
  <li>Is fraudulent or amounts to theft; or</li>
  <li>Causes or has caused the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'} to trade under insolvent circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are not required to design procedures for the specific purpose of identifying reportable irregularities. However, we will consider all information that comes to our attention from any source in order to determine whether a reporting obligation arises. In instances where we are satisfied or have reason to believe that a reportable irregularity has taken place or is taking place, the practitioner responsible and accountable for the review engagement is required, without delay, to send a written report to the Commission. Such a report initiates a series of activities in accordance with Regulation 29 of the Companies Regulations, 2011, pertaining to discussing the report with the members of the Board of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'}, obtaining representations from the Board and sending a final report to the Commission concluding on the existence and status of a reportable irregularity, including information relating to steps that have been taken for the prevention or recovery of any loss as a result thereof (if relevant). Please do not hesitate to contact us if you require further clarification regarding our obligation to report reportable irregularities to the Commission.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fees</strong></em></p>
<p>Our fees are based on the time required by the resources assigned to the engagement. The fees billed are based on the degree of responsibility involved, as well as the level of experience, knowledge and skill required. Our fees, together with disbursements, will be billed as work progresses, and settlement is due on presentation of our invoices.</p>
<p><em><strong>Agreement of terms</strong></em></p>
<p>We look forward to full cooperation with your staff during our review. We are available to discuss this letter with you at any time. Once it has been agreed to, this letter will remain effective for future years unless it is terminated, amended or superseded.

<p><strong>ENGAGEMENT LETTER TO AUDIT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The objective and scope of the audit and our responsibilities</strong></em></p>
<p>You have requested that we audit the financial statements of ${co} for the year ended ${yearEnd}, comprising the statement of financial position, the statement of profit or loss, statement of changes in funds and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Our audit will be made with the objective of our expressing an opinion on the financial statements. We will conduct our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (or refer to relevant national standards or practices). Those Standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Because of the test nature and other inherent limitations of an audit, together with the inherent limitations of any accounting and internal control system, there is an unavoidable risk that even some material misstatements may remain undiscovered. In addition to our report on the financial statements, we expect to provide you with a separate letter concerning any material weaknesses in accounting and internal control systems which come to our notice.</p>
<p><em><strong>Responsibilities of the ${bodyLabel}</strong></em></p>
<p>It is the sole responsibility of the ${bodyLabel} to determine the appropriateness of an audit engagement in the circumstances of the ${entityLabel}, and taking cognizance of any other requirements or agreements that may be applicable to the ${entityLabel}.</p>
<p>Our audit will be conducted on the basis that you acknowledge and understand that you have responsibility:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (IFRS for SMEs)</li>
  <li>For such internal control as you determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and</li>
  <li>To provide us with access to all information of which you are aware that is relevant to the preparation of the financial statements, such as records, documentation and other matters, additional information that we may request from you for the purpose of the review, and unrestricted access to persons within the entity from whom we determine it necessary to obtain evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of our audit, we will request from management and, where appropriate, from those charged with governance, written confirmation concerning representations made to us in connection with the audit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Reporting</strong></em></p>
<p>As stated above, our audit will be conducted with the objective of expressing an audit conclusion on the financial statements as a whole. Our audit conclusion will be communicated in a written report. If the audit conclusion on the financial statements of the ${entityLabel} is unmodified, it is currently expected to read as follows:</p>
<p>"In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position as at ${yearEnd}, and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards for Small and Medium-sized Entities."</p>
<p>However, the form and contents of our report may need to be amended in the light of our findings obtained from the audit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fees</strong></em></p>
<p>Our fees are based on the time required by the resources assigned to the engagement. The fees billed are based on the degree of responsibility involved, as well as the level of experience, knowledge and skill required. Our fees, together with disbursements, will be billed as work progresses, and settlement is due on presentation of our invoices.</p>
<p><em><strong>Agreement of terms</strong></em></p>
<p>We look forward to full cooperation with your staff during our audit. We are available to discuss this letter with you at any time. Once it has been agreed to, this letter will remain effective for future years unless it is terminated, amended or superseded.

<p><strong>ENGAGEMENT LETTER TO AUDIT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>The objective and scope of the audit and our responsibilities</strong></em></p>
<p>You have requested that we audit the financial statements of ${co} for the year ended ${yearEnd}, comprising the statement of financial position, the statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information, and the ${entityType === 'cc' ? "members'" : entityType === 'trust' || entityType === 'bc' ? "trustees'" : "directors'"} report. Our audit will be made with the objective of our expressing an opinion on the financial statements. We will conduct our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (or refer to relevant national standards or practices). Those Standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Because of the test nature and other inherent limitations of an audit, together with the inherent limitations of any accounting and internal control system, there is an unavoidable risk that even some material misstatements may remain undiscovered. In addition to our report on the financial statements, we expect to provide you with a separate letter concerning any material weaknesses in accounting and internal control systems which come to our notice.</p>
<p><em><strong>Responsibilities of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'members' : entityType === 'trust' || entityType === 'bc' ? 'trustees' : 'directors'}</strong></em></p>
<p>The ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'members are' : entityType === 'trust' || entityType === 'bc' ? 'trustees are' : 'directors are'} responsible for the calculation of the public interest score in accordance with Regulation 26 of the Companies Regulations, 2011. The entity's public interest score should be calculated by the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'members' : entityType === 'trust' || entityType === 'bc' ? 'trustees' : 'directors'} at year-end for the current financial year. It is the sole responsibility of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'members' : entityType === 'trust' || entityType === 'bc' ? 'trustees' : 'directors'} to determine the appropriateness of an audit engagement in the circumstances of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'}, in compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act, 2008, and taking cognizance of any other requirements or agreements that may be applicable to the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'}.</p>
<p>Our audit will be conducted on the basis that you acknowledge and understand that you have responsibility:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (IFRS for SMEs) and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa;</li>
  <li>For such internal control as you determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and</li>
  <li>To provide us with access to all information of which you are aware that is relevant to the preparation of the financial statements, such as records, documentation and other matters, additional information that we may request from you for the purpose of the review, and unrestricted access to persons within the entity from whom we determine it necessary to obtain evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of our audit, we will request from management and, where appropriate, from those charged with governance, written confirmation concerning representations made to us in connection with the audit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Reporting</strong></em></p>
<p>As stated above, our audit will be conducted with the objective of expressing an audit conclusion on the financial statements as a whole. Our audit conclusion will be communicated in a written report. If the audit conclusion on the financial statements of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'} is unmodified, it is currently expected to read as follows:</p>
<p>"In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position as at ${yearEnd}, and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards for Small and Medium-sized Entities and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa."</p>
<p>However, the form and contents of our report may need to be amended in the light of our findings obtained from the audit.</p>
<p><em><strong>Reportable irregularities in terms of Regulation 29 of the Companies Regulations, 2011</strong></em></p>
<p>It is our responsibility to inform you regarding our obligation, in terms of Regulation 29 of the Companies Regulations, 2011, to report reportable irregularities to the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (the Commission).</p>
<p>A "reportable irregularity" refers to any act or omission committed by any person responsible for the management of a ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'}, which:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unlawfully has caused or is likely to cause material financial loss to the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'} or to any member, shareholder, creditor or investor of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'} in respect of his, her or its dealings with that entity; or</li>
  <li>Is fraudulent or amounts to theft; or</li>
  <li>Causes or has caused the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'} to trade under insolvent circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are not required to design procedures for the specific purpose of identifying reportable irregularities. However, we will consider all information that comes to our attention from any source in order to determine whether a reporting obligation arises. In instances where we are satisfied or have reason to believe that a reportable irregularity has taken place or is taking place, the practitioner responsible and accountable for the audit engagement is required, without delay, to send a written report to the Commission. Such a report initiates a series of activities in accordance with Regulation 29 of the Companies Regulations, 2011, pertaining to discussing the report with the members of the Board of the ${entityType === 'cc' ? 'close corporation' : 'company'}, obtaining representations from the Board and sending a final report to the Commission concluding on the existence and status of a reportable irregularity, including information relating to steps that have been taken for the prevention or recovery of any loss as a result thereof (if relevant). Please do not hesitate to contact us if you require further clarification regarding our obligation to report reportable irregularities to the Commission.</p>
<p><em><strong>Fees</strong></em></p>
<p>Our fees are based on the time required by the resources assigned to the engagement. The fees billed are based on the degree of responsibility involved, as well as the level of experience, knowledge and skill required. Our fees, together with disbursements, will be billed as work progresses, and settlement is due on presentation of our invoices.</p>
<p><em><strong>Agreement of terms</strong></em></p>

<br>
<p>Dear Directors</p>
<p><strong>Engagement Letter</strong></p>
<p><strong>Independent Auditor's Reasonable Assurance Engagement on Legal Practitioners' Trust Accounts</strong></p>
<p>You have requested that we undertake:</p>
<p><em>A reasonable assurance engagement on whether the legal practitioners' trust accounts of ${co} were maintained, in all material respects, in compliance with Section 86, read with Section 63(1)(g), and Sections 87(1), 87(3) and 87(4) of the Legal Practice Act, No. 28 of 2014 (the Act), and Rules 54.6–54.13, 54.14.1–54.14.6, 54.14.7.2, 54.14.7.3, 54.14.8–54.14.16, 54.15, 54.16, 54.17, 54.18, 54.19, 54.31, 54.32, 54.33, 54.34, 54.35 and 55.1–55.11 of the South African Legal Practice Council Rules (the Rules), made under the authority of Sections 95(1), 95(3) and 109(2) of the Act, for ${periodStr}.</em></p>
<p>We clarify that we are not required to perform any procedures on records or documents relating to accounting for deceased estates, insolvent estates and trusts other than those dealt with via the legal practitioner's trust banking account(s).</p>
<p>In terms of the Advisory issued by the Legal Practice Council dated 17 April 2020, to agree the information extracted from the accounting records and included in the Legal Practitioner's Annual Statement on Trust Accounts for ${periodStr}, to the underlying records that were the subject of our engagement on whether the legal practitioners' trust accounts were maintained in compliance with the Act and the Rules that will accompany our assurance report to be submitted to the Legal Practice Council and report thereon.</p>
<p>In terms of the Advisory issued by the Legal Practice Council dated 17 April 2020, to also read your representations, the disclosures and other information in your Legal Practitioner's Annual Statement on Trust Accounts for the purpose of identifying any information that is inconsistent, based on our knowledge obtained in our engagement on the compliance of your legal practitioners' trust accounts with the Act and the Rules and report thereon.</p>
<p>Further, in terms of Rule 54.24.3, to report on whether or not, to the best of our knowledge, you have for ${periodStr}, carried on the business of an investment practice and complied with the related investment practice Rules, as required.</p>
<p><strong><em>Directors' responsibility for the trust accounts</em></strong></p>
<p>You are responsible for ensuring that your legal practitioners' trust accounts are maintained in compliance with the Act and the Rules; and for such internal control as you determine is necessary to maintain the integrity of those trust accounts in accordance with the relevant client mandates, including such controls as you determine are necessary to prevent and detect fraud and theft. You are also responsible for preparing the Legal Practitioner's Annual Statement on Trust Accounts and for the financial information and declarations contained therein and to provide us with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access to all information that the directors are aware of that is relevant to our engagement, including such business account records as we consider necessary;</li>
  <li><em>Additional information that we may request from the directors for the purpose of our engagement; and</em></li>
  <li>Unrestricted access to persons within the practice from whom we determine it necessary to obtain audit evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are responsible for ensuring that the practice complies with relevant legislation.</p>
<p>As part of our engagement, we will request from you written confirmation concerning representations made to us in connection with our engagement. We will also ask you to confirm in that letter that all important and relevant information has been brought to our attention.</p>
<p><strong><em>Auditor's independence and quality control</em></strong></p>
<p>VDM Audit applies the International Standard on Quality Control 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p><strong><em>Auditor's responsibility</em></strong></p>
<p>Our responsibility is to express a reasonable assurance opinion on whether your legal practitioners' trust accounts were maintained in compliance with the Act and the Rules, based on our assurance procedures performed; and to report, as required, on the Legal Practitioner's Annual Statement on Trust Accounts and investment practice.</p>
<p><em>We will conduct our engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000 (Revised)), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether your legal practitioners' trust accounts were maintained, in all material respects, in compliance with the Act and the Rules, based on our assurance procedures to be performed; and to report, as required, on your Legal Practitioner's Annual Statement on Trust Accounts and investment practice.</em></p>
<p>A reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about whether the legal practitioners' trust accounts were maintained in compliance with the Act and the Rules. The nature, timing and extent of the procedures selected depend on our professional judgement, including the assessment of the risks of non-compliance with the Act and Rules, whether due to fraud, theft and error. In making those risk assessments, we will consider internal control that is relevant to the engagement in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control. Our engagement will include the following procedures:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Considering, and applying when applicable in the engagement circumstances, the guidance in the Guide for Registered Auditors: Engagements on Legal Practitioners' Trust Accounts (Revised March 2020) issued by the IRBA.</em></li>
  <li>Making inquiries of the legal practitioner and persons within the practice.</li>
  <li>Testing of transactions for all significant service activities, with the objective of evaluating whether:
    <ul>
      <li>Transactions were appropriately identified as trust account transactions;</li>
      <li>Trust account transactions were made in accordance with mandates and supported by adequate documentation and narrative to identify from whom funds were received, and for whose credit;</li>
      <li>Deposits and withdrawals from the trust bank accounts were to, or for, a trust creditor; and</li>
      <li>Transfers to the legal practitioner's business bank accounts were only in respect of monies to be due to the legal practitioner.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Testing and/or scrutinising bank reconciliations, as we consider appropriate in the engagement circumstances, and evaluating the records made available to us against the external confirmations requested from financial institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an assurance engagement conducted in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from actions or omissions to act due to fraud, theft or error and are considered material if they, individually or in aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence relevant decisions of users taken on the basis of the subject matter information.</p>
<p>Due to the inherent limitations of an assurance engagement together with the inherent limitations of internal control, there is an unavoidable risk that some material misstatements may not be detected, even though the engagement is properly planned and performed in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised).</p>
<p>We shall not be responsible for reporting on any relevant events or transactions beyond the period covered by our reasonable assurance engagement. As part of an assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised), we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the engagement.</p>
<p><strong><em>Other matters</em></strong></p>
<p>None</p>
<p><strong><em>Our Report on the Compliance of the Legal Practitioner's Trust Accounts with the Act and the Rules</em></strong></p>
<p><em>We expect to issue a report containing an opinion that the legal practitioners' trust accounts of ${co} for ${periodStr} were maintained, in all material respects, in compliance with the Act and the Rules. However, should our evidence obtained not support that opinion, we are required by ISAE 3000 (Revised) to modify our opinion, listing exceptions and instances of non-compliance identified, or giving an explanation for reporting non-compliance.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Our Report on the Legal Practitioner's Annual Statement on Trust Accounts</em></strong></p>
<p>In terms of the Advisory issued by the Legal Practice Council dated 17 April 2020, we expect to report that we have agreed the information included in the attached Legal Practitioner's Annual Statement on Trust Accounts for ${periodStr} to the underlying records that were the subject of our engagement on whether the legal practitioner's trust accounts were maintained in compliance with the Act and the Rules.</p>
<p>We also expect to report that based on our reading of the legal practitioner's representations, the disclosures and other information contained in the Legal Practitioner's Annual Statement on Trust Accounts, we have not identified any information that is inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the course of our engagement. We will state in our report that our opinion on the legal practitioner's trust accounts does not cover the Legal Practitioner's Annual Statement on Trust Accounts and we do not express an opinion thereon.</p>
<p>However, should our evidence obtained not support a positive report, our report will be amended accordingly.</p>
<p>Should we not be able to report as expected, we will discuss matters with you before finalising our report.</p>
<p><strong><em>Our report on the Legal Practitioner's Investment Practice</em></strong></p>
<p>In terms of Rule 54.24.3, we expect to report on whether or not, to the best of our knowledge, you have for ${periodStr}, carried on a business of an investment practice and complied with the related investment practice Rules.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reportable irregularities</em></strong></p>
<p>Please note that this assurance engagement meets the definition of audit, as contained in the Auditing Profession Act, 2005 (APA). We are subject to the requirements of Section 45 of the APA, and have a duty to report to the IRBA on reportable irregularities, as defined in the APA, that may be identified in the course of our engagement.</p>
<p>Where a reportable irregularity has been reported to the IRBA, we are required to include a paragraph on "Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements" in our report, disclosing information relating to the reportable irregularity.</p>
<p><strong><em>Non-compliance with Laws and Regulations</em></strong></p>
<p>We wish to draw your attention to the professional obligation of the directors and employees of the audit firm to respond to identified or suspected Non-compliance with Laws and Regulations, as required in terms of Section 360 of the IRBA Code; and this may include the reporting of the non-compliance or suspected non-compliance to an appropriate authority under the appropriate circumstances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Restriction on the use and distribution of our report</em></strong></p>
<p>Our report will state that it is provided for the purpose indicated in the report; and it is not suitable for any other purpose; and that it is intended solely for your use, that of the Legal Practice Council and the Legal Practitioners Fidelity Fund; and should not be distributed to other parties.</p>
<p>Please sign and return the attached copy of this letter to indicate your acknowledgement of, and agreement with, the arrangements for our reasonable assurance engagement on whether your legal practitioners' trust accounts were maintained in compliance with the Act and the Rules; and to report, as required, on the Legal Practitioner's Annual Statement on Trust Accounts and investment practice, including our respective responsibilities.</p>

<p>Dear Sir</p>
<br>
<p><strong>${coUpper}</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Registration Number ${reg})</strong></p>
<br>
<p>In connection with your examination of the financial statements for the year ended on <strong>${yearEnd ? yearEnd.toUpperCase() : '[YEAR END]'}</strong> we confirm to the best of our knowledge and belief that:</p>
<ol style="font-size:9.5pt;line-height:1.65;padding-left:22px;margin-top:10px;">
  <li>The financial statements fairly present the financial position and results of operations in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards for Small and Medium-sized Entities.</li>
  <li>All minutes of the meetings of ${reprSignatories} and committees (or summaries of actions of recent meetings for which minutes have not yet been prepared) and all financial and accounting records and related data have been made available to you.</li>
  <li>We are not aware of any material accounts, transactions or agreement which are not fairly described and properly recorded in the accounting records, which could have any material effect on the financial statements.</li>
  <li>We are not aware of:
    <ul style="margin-top:4px;">
      <li>any irregularities involving management or employees who have significant roles in the system of internal accounting control or any irregularities involving other employees which could have a material effect on the financial statements; or</li>
      <li>any violations or possible violations of laws or regulations whose effect should be considered for disclosure in the financial statements or as a basis for recording a contingent loss.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adequate provision not considered to be excessive, has been made for:
    <ul style="margin-top:4px;">
      <li>All known material liabilities, other than contingent liabilities in respect of which no actual liability is expected to arise, which existed at the balance sheet date;</li>
      <li>all material losses expected to arise from events which had occurred by the statement of financial position date.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>At the statement of financial position date, except as provided for or as noted in the financial statements, there were no material contingent liabilities.</li>
  <li>Except as indicated in the financial statements:
    <ul style="margin-top:4px;">
      <li>none of the liabilities was secured, otherwise than by the operation of law, on any assets of ${reprAssets}</li>
      <li>the assets reflected in the statement of financial position were owned by ${reprAssets} at the statement of financial position date, free of any charges in favour of third parties.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>At the statement of financial position date: there were no commitments under contracts placed for capital expenditure or capital expenditure authorised by ${reprSignatories} which had not been contracted for which were not disclosed in the financial statements.</li>
  <li>The method by which management proposes to finance commitments for any capital expenditure either contracted for or authorised is adequately disclosed in the financial statements.</li>
  <li>The net book amounts at which the premises, plant and equipment are stated in the statement of financial position were arrived at after:
    <ul style="margin-top:4px;">
      <li>taking into account as additions all expenditure during the year which represented capital outlay on these assets but no expenditure of a revenue nature;</li>
      <li>writing off all amounts relating to items which had been sold or scrapped by the statement of financial position date;</li>
      <li>providing for depreciation on a scale sufficient to cover obsolescence as well as wear and tear and thus to reduce the net book amounts of the assets to their residual value by the time they become no longer economically useful to ${reprAssets}.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Any decline in the value of long term investments not provided for is considered to be of a temporary nature.</li>
  <li>Current assets shown in the balance sheet are all expected to produce at least the amounts at which they are stated on realisation in the ordinary course of the business.</li>
  <li>Except as disclosed in the financial statements, the results of operations for the year were not materially affected by transactions of an extraordinary or abnormal nature, or items relative to a prior year.</li>
  <li>Material commitments for future purchases are for quantities not in excess of anticipated requirements, and are at prices which should not result in loss. Material losses are not expected to be sustained in the fulfilment of, or the inability to fulfil, any sales commitments.</li>
  ${reprShares}
  <li>The ${reprEntityLabel} has complied with all aspects of contractual agreements that could have a material effect on the financial statements in the event of non-compliance, except as disclosed in the financial statements.</li>
  <li>Known events subsequent to the statement of financial position date have been accounted for or appropriately disclosed in so far as they materially affect fair presentation in the financial statements.</li>
  <li>Stocks is valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value and represent the total value of all stock on hand at year end.</li>
  <li>The amount shown as trade debtors reflect the total debts owed to ${reprAssets} as per the books of account, after writing off bad debts. To the best of our knowledge all debtors at year end have been taken into account, as well as all other accounts receivable.</li>
  <li>All trade creditors and other liabilities have been brought to account and the figure shown in the statement of financial position represents to the best of our knowledge the total amount due for trade and other creditors.</li>
